v.1.53
Now resolves (arbitrarily) multifurcating nodes. NCBI-anchoring by default.


v.1.52
Another (not very good) way to infer ancestral sequences.


v.1.51
First release of PAGAN2. Now using built-in BLAST library (instead of Exonerate) 
and doing efficient alignment achoring that massively reduces the memory usage. 
Can now align closely related sequences that are up to megabases long on a regular
laptop computer.


v.0.61
Fixed a serious bug in query placement of indeopendent sequences: previously
substrings (insertions) may have been left out of the resulting alignment.
Also fixed the branch length computtaion for the new added sequences.
PAGAN code is now hosted at github: changed the update check to reflect that.


v.0.60
Using now explicit data types for Exonerate. Previously DNA sequences with
lots of ambiguous characters could be handled as proteins and search failed.


v.0.59
Fixing an issue with multiple placement of the same query. Adding a new option
"--output-discarded-queries" for one-by-one placement. Enabling placement to newly
added taxa now also for translated data. Speedup for Exonerate search.


v.0.58
Adding ancestral sequence reconstruction for codon data when "--translate" is used.
A backup system for cases where BppAncestors fails.


v.0.57
Faster reference build (mainly for aa/codons). Less verbose output. Exonerate hits
trimmed to avoid overlapping hits.


v.0.56
By mistake, outputted pruned files for every alignment. This now fixed.


v.0.55
Re-writing the program homepage. Compatible with that. Several changes in
placement heuristics and tree extension


v.0.54
- cleaning up: many unused options removed
- xml output with nhx tags
- changed search order of external tools
- now using BppAncestors for ancestor reconstruction


v.0.53
- TID tags now considered also for ORFs
- fixing the double naming of ORFs
- changed a bad default value for branch-skip-probability (not fixing the bug yet!)


v.0.52
- consistent naming of nucleotide and protein output of ORF alignments
- improvements for alignment pruning
- option to trim extended alignment


v.0.51
- functions for alignment pruning (to reduce large datasets)
- anchoring coverage threshold for skipping the DP alignment altogether
- find-best-orf and compare-reverse with placement

v.0.50
- improvements for pileup of 454 data
- removing gaps from query sequences


v.0.49
Still in development:
 - new option to create a distance tree using bpp_dist package.
 - significant changes (and improvements) for pileup alignment of 454 reads.


v.0.48
- new option: --test-every-terminal-node


v.0.47
- compiles on Darwin and Cygwin


v.0.46
- first integration of MAFFT and RAxML


v.0.45
- reorganised code and fixed recently created bugs


v.0.44
- alignment anchoring with Exonerate or substring matching


v.0.43
- corrected multi-threading for standard multiple alignment


v.0.42
- first attempt for multi-threading for standard multiple alignment


v.0.41
- minor change in how the sequence name is read: no space in the end of line


v.0.40
- reverting earlier changes: now alignment model is again recomputed for each alignment


v.0.39
- selenocysteins are now converted to X
- fixed bugs in the tree parser and use of branch lengths


v.0.38
- minor fixes on program options
- documentation updated


v.0.37
- changes in phylogenetic placement using Exonerate: can run all at one go
- renaming some command line arguments. Please check 'pagan --help'


v.0.36
- fixed the Makefile and issues giving compilation warnings


v.0.35
- new output system: less noise; allows outputting to a file
- translated read alignment with ORF search
- experiments with optimal reference search for read alignment without a reference


v.0.34
- can test also reverse-complement and keep better (for read alignment)
- can do multiple rounds of read placement to find overlap


v.0.33
- query sequence matching equally well to several targets is placed to multiple locations
- alternative scores for choosing the target: default self-normalised substitution score
- the source code now at http://code.google.com/p/pagan-msa/


v.0.32
- option '--454' works also with FASTA-formatted sequences


v.0.31
- option for contig build to show ancestral sequence across gaps
- option to use more appropriate default settings for PacBio pileup


v.0.30
- separation of consensus ancestor reconstruction and contig assembly
- corrected read order in consensus alignment


v.0.29
- preliminary support for contig assembly
- consensus ancestors for (DNA) read alignment


v.0.28
- preliminary support for read pileup using consensus ancestors


v.0.27
- integrated Exonerate to speed up the search for placement nodes


v.0.26
- repaired the broken ancestor reconstruction: now also for codon data.


v.0.25
- bug fix: reads can now also be aligned against tagged leaf nodes.
- added option to search optimal placement among internal only or all nodes.


v.0.24
- added option '--version' to check for updates.


v.0.23
- this is the first version with the complete set of features described in the manuscript.
